// Explain how web works

The web works through a system a of request to a server. 
The server(computer) recieves instructions from the web and returns response to browser. 
As web users we send our request through url addresses and the computer and web work together to find the data we are searching in our url.
Our url addresses are broken into four parts to assist the web browser and web server to read our searches on the web.

When we click on links on the web, domain names (hostnames) are converted into IP Address that the server can read. 
Request are made on the web server and require a response for returned results.
If request and response are completed we are allowed to retrieve data from the hostname.
